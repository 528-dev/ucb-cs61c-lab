question1.What do the .data, .word, .text directives mean (i.e. what do you use them for)? Hint: think about the 4 sections of memory.
answer1:
    .data denotes data storage
    .word denotes a data holds a word memory
    .text denotes code storage 

question2.Run the program to completion. What number did the program output? What does this number represent?
answer2:
    output: 34
    the number represent the integer in a1 is 34

question3.At what address is n stored in memory? Hint: Look at the contents of the registers.
answer3:
    at mem[0x10000010]

question4.Without actually editing the code (i.e. without going into the "Edito" tab), have the program calculate the 13th fib number (0-indexed) by manually modifying the value of a register. You may find it helpful to first step through the code. If you prefer to look at decimal values, change the "Display Setting" option at the bottom.
answer4:
    set x28 = 13 after executing la t3, n
