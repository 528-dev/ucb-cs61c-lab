The register representing the variable k.
answer:
    k in reg[t0], k * 4 in reg[t1]

The register representing the variable sum.
answer:
    sum in reg[s0]

The registers acting as pointers to the source and dest arrays.
answer:
   reg[s1] point to source and reg[s2] point to dest

The assembly code for the loop found in the C code.
answer:
    loop and square block

How the pointers are manipulated in the assembly code.
answer:
    reg[t3] point to dest[k] and reg[t1] point to source[k]
    t3 manipulated by reg[s2](dest) adding reg[t1](k * 4)
    t1 manipulated by reg[s1](source) adding reg[t1](k * 4)
